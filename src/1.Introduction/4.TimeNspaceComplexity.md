# Time Complexity
- Amount of time required to complete a particular portion of a process
- Depends on the procedure we are implementing inside a program

## Examples

1. **Example:**  `A[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`  
- In order to add or search, we require **N number of steps**, so the time complexity is **O(N)**.

2. **Example:** - If we want to compare a number `X` with each value inside the array and we use a nested loop, then the time taken is  **N × N**, so the time complexity is **O(N²)**

3. **Example:** - If we process only half of the list i.e., find the middle element, divide into first half and second half and again find the middle and this continues until it reaches 1, then time complexity is represented as **O(log N)**

4. **Example:** - In tree, the time taken is **O(log N)** because it is hierarchy-based data structure and operations follow divide and search.


## Example Programmes

### 1.

```c
void swap(int x, int y)
{
    int t;
    t = x;   // 1
    x = y;   // 1
    y = t;   // 1
}

- Total F(N) = 3
- Since there is no loop, the power of N is 0. So time complexity is O(1) 

2.
int sum(int A[], int N)
{
    int s, i;
    s = 0;               // 1
    for(i = 0; i < N; i++) // N + 1
    {
        s = s + A[i];    // N
    }
    return s;            // 1
}

- Total F(N) = 2N + 3
- Here highest degree of N is 1, so the time complexity is O(N) 

3. 
void Add(int n)
{
    int i, j;
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++)        // N + 1
    {
        for(j = 0; j < n; j++)    // N × (N + 1)
        {
            C[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j]; // N × N
        }
    }
}
Total F(N) = N(square of 2) + 2N + 1 = Here highest degree of N is 2 so time take is order of N(Square)
