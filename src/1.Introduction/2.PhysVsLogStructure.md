# Physical vs Logical Data Structure

## Physical Data Structure
- Physical data structure defines **how data is stored and organized in memory**.

### Array
1. Example: Array because this data structure defines how memory is organized and allocated  
2. Array data structure has **contiguous memory locations** and its size is **fixed** meaning it **cannot be extended at runtime**  
3. Should be used only when the **quantity of inputs is known and finite**

### Linked List
1. Completely **dynamic data structure** because its collection of nodes are created **at runtime in heap memory**  
2. Size of data is **not fixed** and can grow or reduce dynamically


So data is stored in memory and developers require operations like **insert, delete, search, update**, etc.
The question is:
**In what discipline should these operations be performed?**

## Logical Data Structure
Logical data structure defines **discipline** of how operations are performed on data stored in memory.
Examples:
1. Stack  
2. Queue  
3. Tree  
4. Graph  
5. Hash Table  

### Linear Data Structures
- **STACK**  
  - Works on discipline: **LIFO (Last In First Out)**

- **QUEUE**  
  - Works on discipline: **FIFO (First In First Out)**

### Non-Linear Data Structures
- **TREE**  
  - Works on: **Hierarchical structure**

- **GRAPH**  
  - Works on: **Collection of nodes (vertices) and links (edges)**

### Hash Table
- Hash table is a **non-linear data structure**
- Stores data in **key–value pairs**
- Uses a **hash function** for fast access


## Relationship Between Physical and Logical Data Structures
- Logical data structures define **how data should be used** while physical data structures define **how data is stored**.
- To implement logical data structures, we use physical data structures such as:
- - Array  
- - Linked List  
- - or **combination of Array and Linked List**
