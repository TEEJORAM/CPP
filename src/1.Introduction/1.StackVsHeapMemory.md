# General Discussion
1. Memory is divided into small addressable units called BYTE
2. Every BYTE has its own address

For example:
1. First memory address is 0 BYTE and last address is 65535 BYTE
→ 65536 bytes = 64 × 1024 = 64 KB
2. Entire RAM is not used as single block → Divided into manageable pieces called segments (such as code, stack, heap, data).
3. Whatever variable created inside a function, it will be created under STACK memory and that portion of memory given to an function is called Activation Record (Stack Frame)
4. Size of memory required by a function’s local variables is decided at compile time and that memory is obtained in stack when the function starts executing.
5. How many bytes of memory required by a function’s local variables is decided at compile time
6. When memory allocation is done at compile time/before runtime, we call it STATIC allocation

## Stack behavior for sequence of functions
1. Stack memory is organized in LIFO order (Last In First Out)
2. Activation records of functions are created one by one after calls from main(). Once a function ends, its activation record is automatically removed, and control returns to the caller ->> After program execution ends, memory for variables in main() is also released->> **That is why it is called STACK memory**

## HEAP
1. Heap memory is unorganized (no fixed order like stack)
2. Heap memory should be used as a resource meaning it should be released when not required
3. Program can't access heap memory directly and it's accessed via pointers/references
4. After using heap memory, we should delete/free it -> Else that memory cannot be reused, causing memory leak
