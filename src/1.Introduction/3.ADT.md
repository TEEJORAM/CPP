# Abstract Data Type

## What is Data Type?
- Representation of data (how data is stored)
- Operations on data such as +, -, *, /, %, ++, and --

## Abstract
- Means hiding internal details
- For example: While performing operations such as +, - or *, do we need to know how they are performed in binary form inside main memory? **No**, because we are concerned only with declaring a variable and using it to perform these operations(Internal details are abstracted)

- For example: When we declare  `int x;`-> we know it's a primitive data type

## Abstract Data Type (ADT)
- For representing list of numbers → 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, we require data such as:
  1. Space for storing elements
  2. Capacity (MAX)
  3. Size (ACTUAL)

- Operations such as:
  - append(x)
  - insert(i, x)
  - remove(i)
  - replace(i, x)
  - search(x)
  - contains(x)
  - sort()
  etc.,.

- so a list has:
  - Representation of data
  - Operations on data

- When both are combined and internal details are hidden, it can be used as **new data type** called as **Abstract Data Type**
