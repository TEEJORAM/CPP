## 🚀 How to Approach Pattern Questions?

Before writing a pattern program, follow these steps:

1. **Figure out the number of lines to be printed** ➝ Typically, this is the number of rows (`n`).
2. **Analyze the number of columns in each row** ➝ Usually depends on row number.
3. **Identify the relation between rows and columns** ➝ Look for any mathematical relations.
4. **Observe the pattern structure** ➝ Symmetry, increasing/decreasing order, spaces, etc.
5. **Implement nested loops** ➝ Outer loop for rows and inner loop for columns.
6. **Use conditions inside the loop** ➝ For specific pattern shapes.
